# Roadrunner and Pathing Tutorials

## Background

When working with robot pathing for FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) teams, many developers and teams face challenges when trying to implement effective navigation systems. Two common approaches that teams struggle with are **Roadrunner** (a popular pathing library) and **Pedo Pathing** (a method for calculating robot movement using odometry). 

We recognized that there was a lack of clear and accessible tutorials that could guide new teams through setting up these pathing systems and making the most of them. As a result, many teams end up reinventing the wheel, spending countless hours on trial and error, rather than focusing on their actual robot tasks.

## The Collaboration

At **Virginia City Silver Circuits** and **URSA Major FTC**, we believe that collaboration is key to overcoming challenges in the FTC community. Both of our teams have faced similar struggles when it comes to implementing complex pathing systems like Roadrunner and Pedo Pathing. We felt the need to create a space where teams could access tutorials, guides, and code that would make implementing these systems easier and more efficient.

### What We Are Doing

To address this gap, **Virginia City Silver Circuits** and **URSA Major FTC** have teamed up to build comprehensive tutorials and documentation. The goal is to make it easier for teams to integrate pathing libraries, understand the underlying principles of pathing, and efficiently navigate the challenges that come with autonomous robot control.

Our tutorials will cover:

- **Basic setup** of Roadrunner and Pedo Pathing in an FTC robot project.
- **Step-by-step guides** for configuring the pathing libraries with your robot hardware and sensors.
- **Best practices** for tuning and optimizing pathing algorithms.
- **Examples and code snippets** to get you started quickly.
  
With this collaboration, we aim to help the FTC community at large by providing high-quality, accessible resources that will allow teams to use their time and resources more effectively.

## Why It Matters

By sharing knowledge and working together, we hope to empower FTC teams of all experience levels to achieve better results with autonomous pathing. The tutorials and resources we’re developing will give teams the tools they need to create reliable and efficient autonomous programs, and ultimately, perform better in their competitions.

We invite other teams and developers to contribute to this growing resource pool. If you have insights, tutorials, or improvements, we’d love to hear from you. Together, we can help more teams succeed in their FTC journey!
