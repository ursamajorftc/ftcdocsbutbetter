## The Need for Tutorials on Roadrunner and Pedro Pathing

In the world of competitive robotics, particularly for FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), teams are always looking for ways to optimize their robots’ performance. One of the areas that we realized had a gap in available tutorials was pathing. Specifically, **Roadrunner** and **Pedro** pathing—two popular path-following libraries used in FTC—did not have comprehensive guides that we could rely on. 

Roadrunner, being a motion-planning library, and Pedro, a custom pathing library, both require specific knowledge to implement properly. Many teams were left with little guidance on how to use these tools to their fullest potential. Through discussions with teams and our own experiences, we discovered that a lot of the needed tutorials were either nonexistent or hard to find. 

To fill this void, we decided to compile our knowledge into this documentation, making it easier for other teams to implement and benefit from these tools in their own robots.

## Collaboration Between Virginia City Silver Circuits and URSA Major FTC

By collaborating on these docs, we are able to create resources for the FTC Community. We are 2 passionate teams that enjoy robotics and we hope you suceed this year!

By joining forces, Virginia City Silver Circuits and URSA Major FTC aim to elevate the community’s understanding of complex robot programming techniques. Our collective knowledge in these areas is being passed on to help teams in their journey to achieve more precise and effective robot movements on the field.

We hope that this collaboration will inspire other teams to share their knowledge, create resources, and help grow the FTC community as a whole.
