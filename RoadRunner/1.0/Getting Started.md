## Let's get started:


The quickest way to get started with Road Runner is by using the **Quickstart** project. This is a fully configured **FTC Android Studio project** that includes:

- **Road Runner** (for motion planning)  
- **FTC Dashboard** (for real-time telemetry)  
- **Tuning utilities** (for optimizing robot movement)  

## How to Get It  
You can download the Quickstart project from the **[GitHub page](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart)** or clone it using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart.git
```
Don't have Git installed? Go [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for a tutorial on installing Git. 

Once done, you can start tuning!
